#TDD(Test driven development)

[Test driven development in C](https://www.slideshare.net/amritayan/test-driven-development-in-c)

> With TDD you are still "allowed" to do a lot of up-front design if you finde it useful to understand the problem domain, but you should try to let your tests drive the design process. 
Doing TDD corectly, you will find that sometimes you end up with a surprisingly simple and solid design. The key idea is that you can evolve the design by telling the system **what** it should do, rather that **how** it shold do it.
